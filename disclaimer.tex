\section*{Disclaimer}
 These are notes from Math 252, Fall 2005, taught by professor Weinstein.  I
 try to make them accurate and correct, but they are still full of errors and
 typos and logical gaps. Send comments/corrections/whatever to
 \texttt{geraschenko@gmail.com}.  Specifically, don't hesitate to send me an
 email to remind me to post the latest notes.
